TMNT Arena documentation (Out of date)

== Overview ==
This is the overview of how things ''should'' work, it should be noted with the status.

=== Weapon System<sup>unfinished</sup>===
:'''Status'''
* Default weapon: Working
* Pickup weapons: Working
* Guns: Working
* Melee weapon: Unfinished

The weapon system is based on that of TMNT: Mutant Melee.

Each player has a default weapon that they always have. Each player may pickup a extra weapon and may not use there default weapon while holding a extra weapon. The player is limited to one pickup weapon and one default weapon. Currently when a player pickup a pickup weapon when holding a pickup weapon, they have three weapon while "changing" from old pickup weapon to new pickup weapon.

In TMNT: Mutant Melee, button press is required to pickup weapons, instead of by touch.<sup>not started, bad idea</sup>

:'''Setting default weapon'''
The server tells everyone what their default weapon is base on the players that they have, with a default ''default weapon'' if the server doesn't have the player.

=== Player game config<sup>working</sup> ===
"animations.cfg" is loaded by "game" to get more information about the player, allowing players to be more different from each other (like in SRB2).

It can hold the player's default weapon, bounding box, max speed, and acceleration. In the future it may hold other various things as well.

=== Shurikens<sup>Working</sup> ===
Shurikens are separate from the normal weapons, they are holdable items with multiple uses.

Currently they can be throw and they do damage, explode, bounce, etc. The electric shuriken does not yet stun players or electrify water. In the future the electric, fire, and laser shurikens will be more than just recolored models, by adding sparks, flames, and glowing effects.
