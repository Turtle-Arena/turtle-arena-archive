This file may help with creating addons for TMNT Arena. Currently it won't help much.

NOTE: Redoing and moving to the Google Code Wiki.

== Overview ==
:''If you have editing knowlegde of Quake III Arena or any other id tech 3 game you can skip this.''
In TMNT Arena all of the data is stored in a .pk3 files, which are simply renamed .zip files.
Pk3 files can be extracted with any zip program.

TODO: More on this later.

== Players ==
There isn't a guide yet but if you open base/pak0.pk3 and look in "models/players/raph/" there is a full Raphael player. It is mostly the same as a Quake3 player, so you should be able to find information on the Web.

Also see tmnt-editing-players.txt

=== Animation.cfg ===
TMNT Arena addes new keywords to animation.cfg

TODO: More on this later.

==== SoundPath ====
By placing "soundpath dir" in animation.cfg the player will use sounds from "sound/dir/*" instead of "sound/PLAYERDIR/*"


=== Skins ===
Below is the seach order for ".skin" files in TMNT Arena. It uses code from Quake III: Team Arena to allow per-team skins. So Team Arena Players work in Team gametypes as well as Quake 3 players.

Note: "raph/mirage" is a example; raph is the model, mirage is the skin.

==== Head ====
:Team play
headmodel = raph/mirage
team = red

models/players/raph/mirage/head_red.skin
models/players/raph/head_red.skin
models/players/heads/raph/mirage/head_red.skin
models/players/heads/raph/head_red.skin

:Non-Team play
headmodel = raph/mirage

models/players/raph/head_mirage.skin
models/players/heads/raph/head_mirage.skin

Note: If headmodel starts with '*' ("*raph/mirage") the "heads" directory is checked then "players" directory is check.

==== Body (lower/upper) ====
:Team play
model = raph/mirage
team = red
g_redTeam = Sais

models/players/raph/Sais/lower_mirage_red.skin
models/players/raph/Sais/lower_red.skin
models/players/raph/lower_mirage_red.skin
models/players/raph/lower_red.skin
models/players/characters/raph/Sais/lower_mirage_red.skin
models/players/characters/raph/Sais/lower_red.skin
models/players/characters/raph/lower_mirage_red.skin
models/players/characters/raph/lower_red.skin

:Non-Team play
model = raph/mirage

models/players/raph/lower_mirage.skin
models/players/characters/raph/lower_mirage.skin
