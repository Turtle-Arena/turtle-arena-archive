What MISSIONPACK adds to TMNT, the plan is to remove and intagrate all parts of the MP into base TMNT.

* Scriptable UI/HUD
* 3 more gametypes
** One Flag CTF --Supported (with data)
*** Take the center flag to the other team's base.
** Overload --Supported (with data)
*** Defend object at base and attack other teams base object.
** Harvester --Removed (!defined MISSIONPACK_HARVESTER)
*** kill people, then a skull (of the attacker's team color) will spawn at the center object, then attacker's team must take the skull to the other team's base, if killee's team touch it [object that spawned at center], it is removed.)
* Teams, 5 bots team-name and gfx, good for multiplayer with bots in Team Gametypes (and for clans online?). (Is that all?)
* Persistant Powerups (For Team gametypes)
** Scout (Incressed speed, and no armor? (armor is removed in TMNT Arena) ) (speed is 1.5, haste speed is 1.3)
***  Turtle Man: NOTE: I cut start health and pickup health in half.

** Guard (Incressed health, and Health regen)           (2x health, PW_BATTLESUIT is .5 damage receive)
***  Turtle Man: NOTE: I disabled Health regen (Seems overpowered) and give 2x health from pickup items.

** Doubler (Player weapons do double damage.)           (Like Q3 PW_QUAD, as I set it 2x damage)
** Ammo Regen (Player ammo/shuriken counts slowly increment)
* Voice chats for bots and humans
* Per-team skins for players

* 3 New Weapons
** chain gun (Removed)
** nail gun (Removed)
** prox launcher (Removed)
* 3 New Holdable Items
** Kamikaze holdable item (Removed)
** Invul holdable item (Removed)
** Portal (Not used in final version of Team Arena)
*** I did some fixing to the code and added models and an icon, it is usable.
