* One Flag CTF gametype: Take the center flag to the other team's base.
* Overload gametype: Defend object at base and attack other teams base object.

* Persistant Powerups (For Team gametypes)

***  Turtle Man: NOTE: I cut start health and pickup health in half.

** Guard (Incressed health, and Health regen)           (2x health, PW_BATTLESUIT is .5 damage receive)
***  Turtle Man: NOTE: I disabled Health regen (Seems overpowered) and give 2x health from pickup items.

** Doubler (Player weapons do double damage.)           (Like Q3 PW_QUAD, as I set it 2x damage)
** Ammo Regen (Player ammo/shuriken counts slowly increment)
