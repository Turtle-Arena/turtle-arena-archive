What MISSIONPACK adds to TMNT, the plan is to remove and intagrate all parts of the MP into base TMNT.
It doesn't seem like it adds much.


* Scriptable UI
* Scriptable HUD
* 3 more gametypes
** One Flag CTF --Supported (with data)
*** Take the center flag to the other team's base.
** Overload --Supported (with data)
*** Defend object at base and attack other teams base object.
** Harvester --Removed (!defined MISSIONPACK_HARVESTER)
*** kill people, then a skull (of the attacker's team color) will spawn at the center object, then attacker's team must take the skull to the other team's base, if killee's team touch it [object that spawned at center], it is removed.)
* Teams, 5 bots team-name and gfx, good for multiplayer with bots in Team Gametypes (and for clans online?). (Is that all?)
* Persistant Powerups (For Team gametypes)
** Scout (Incressed speed, and no armor? (armor is removed in TMNT anyway) ) (Is this the same speed of PW_HASTE?)
** Guard (Incressed health)                             (2x health, PW_BATTLESUIT is .5 damage receive)
** Doubler (Player weapons do double damage.)           (Like Q3 PW_QUAD, I set it 2x damage)
** Ammo Regen (Player ammo counts slowly increment, what of melee weapons?)
* Voice chats for bots and humans
* Per-team skins for players


* 3 New Weapons
** chain gun (Removed)
** nail gun (Removed)
** prox launcher (Removed)
* 3 New Holdable Items
** Kamikaze holdable item (Removed)
** Invul holdable item (Removed)
** Portal (Not used in final game, still in code (I haven't disabled it))

== Remove ==
=== Kamikaze ===
: Possibly reuse Kamikaze explotions? For Oil Barrels or something? --no
