What MISSIONPACK adds to TMNT, the plan is to remove and intagrate all parts of the MP into base TMNT.

* Scriptable UI
* Scriptable HUD
* 3 more gametypes
** One Flag CTF --Supported (with data)
*** Take the center flag to the other team's base.
** Overload [Obelisk] --TODO: Add data support (and rename?).
*** Defend object at base and attack other teams base object.
** Harvester --Removed (!defined MISSIONPACK_HARVESTER)
*** kill people, then a skull (of the attacker's team color) will spawn at the center object, then attacker's team must take the skull to the other team's base, if killee's team touch it [object that spawned at center], it is removed.)
* Teams, good for multiplayer with bots in Team Gametypes (and for clans online?). (Is that all?)
* Persistant Powerups (For Teamgame types)
** Scout (Incressed speed, and no armor?(armor is removed in TMNT anyway) )
** Guard (Incressed health)
** Doubler (Player weapons do double damage.)
** Ammo Regen (Player ammo counts slowly increment, what of melee weapons?)
* Voice chats for bots


* 3 New Weapons
** chain gun (Removed)
** nail gun (Removed)
** prox launcher (Removed)
* 3 New Holdable Items
** Kamikaze holdable item (Removed)
** Invul holdable item (Removed)
** Portal (Not used in final game, still in code (I haven't disabled it))

== Remove ==
=== Kamikaze ===
: Possibly reuse Kamikaze explotions? For Oil Barrels or something?
