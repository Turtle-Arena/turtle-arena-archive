The current player, raph_v8.mm3d, is a mix of raph_v8.wings and raph_v9.wings.
Raph_v9 is the work-in-progress to fix and improve the model, some of which has been backported to raph_v8.mm3d.

raph_v9.mm3d bone joint notes:
u_torso_control Torso can rotate just the torso
joint_torso     Legs can rotate the torso
root			Legs can rotate the whole model
l_legs_control	Legs can rotate just the legs

== TODO ==
Split arms from torso, it would solve some animation issues with the sholder going flat when rotated...
: For Example: TORSO_GUARDBASE frame 4

Raph's thumbs also go flat and should be fixed.
