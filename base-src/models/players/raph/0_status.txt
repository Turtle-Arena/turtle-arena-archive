The current player, raph_v8.mm3d, is a mix of raph_v8.wings and raph_v9.wings.
Raph_v9 is the work-in-progress to fix and improve the model, some of which has been backported to raph_v8.mm3d.

raph_v9.mm3d bone joint notes:
u_torso_control Torso can rotate just the torso
joint_torso     Legs can rotate the torso
root			Legs can rotate the whole model
l_legs_control	Legs can rotate just the legs


==Missing animations for raph_v9==

Needs (32) torso attack animations,
LEGS_RUN doesn't look quite done,
I want to modify four torso standing animations, see (copy of ..., the animation it defaults to)

The 'shared' (used by all weapons) torso animations should be modfied so Bo Staff doesn't go into the ground...

== Note ==
cg_shadows 2 doesn't not work correctly with the model for some reason.
Is it due to the holes in the meshes?


== Converting Wings3D to MM3D ==
Export the model from wings3d into an .obj model. Import the .obj into MisfitModel3D.

Raph's mouth is just a different material on the h_head_bottom mesh
	when exported it needs to be renamed to h_mouth_right and h_mouth_left in the mm3d model

== TODO ==
Raph's thumb get a little weird when rotated, should it be fixed?
