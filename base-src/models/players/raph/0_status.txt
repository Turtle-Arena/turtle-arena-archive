The current player, raph_v8.mm3d, is a mix of raph_v8.wings and raph_v9.wings.
Raph_v9 is the work-in-progress to fix and improve the model, some of which has been backported to raph_v8.mm3d.

raph_v9.mm3d bone joint notes:
u_torso_control Torso can rotate just the torso
joint_torso     Legs can rotate the torso
root			Legs can rotate the whole model
l_legs_control	Legs can rotate just the legs


==Missing animations for raph_v9==

== Notes ==
Changed head to be split into bottom, mask, and top (instead of left/right).
	Haven't updated raph_v9.mm3d!


== TODO ==
Split arms from torso, it would solve some animation issues with the sholder going flat when rotated...
: For Example: TORSO_GUARDBASE frame 4
