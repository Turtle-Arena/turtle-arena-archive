== Attack animations ==
  * A - swing right to left, cutting motion
  * B - swing left to right, cutting motion
  * C - raise weapon in air and swing to the ground, attacking directly infront on player

  * Running - only torso animates A B ...(continues without delay)
    * BOTH_ATTACK_*_A
    * BOTH_ATTACK_*_B

  * Standing - torso and legs can animate A B A C (attack delay)
    * BOTH_ATTACK_*_A
    * BOTH_ATTACK_*_B
    * BOTH_ATTACK_*_A
    * BOTH_ATTACK_*_C

== Notes ==
cg_shadows 2 doesn't not work correctly with the model for some reason.
Is it due to the holes in the meshes?

Bo Staff goes in the floor during the raise and drop torso animations.
  * wontfix: The animations are very short (~1/5 second and ~1/4 second), who will see and care?

Raph's thumb get a little weird when rotated, should it be fixed?

== Converting Wings3D to MM3D ==
Export the model from wings3d into an .obj model. Import the .obj into MisfitModel3D.

Raph's mouth is just a different material on the h_head_bottom mesh
	when exported it needs to be renamed to h_mouth_right and h_mouth_left in the mm3d model
