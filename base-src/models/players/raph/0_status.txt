DONE: I need to reskin the head model
DONE: Have eyes on image, but have them as there own mesh for $whitemap and not lightmap?
DONE (Well its skinned...): Finish carapace (shell back) mesh and skin it.
DONE: I would like to have the torso use "mirror skining" see tmnt-editing-players.txt.

Had to split hands into there own meshes (In .mmd3 and .md3), I haven't updated the Wings3D file as of yet.
