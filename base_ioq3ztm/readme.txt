This directory contains replacement data for quake3 that is no longer used by
	Turtle Arena. May be useful for creating a full quake3 data replacement or
	something when combined with the Turtle Arena data.
	Note, PNG/OGG are only support by ioquake3, so would need to be convert
	to TGA/WAV to support original quake3.
