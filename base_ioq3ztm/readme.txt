This directory contains replacement data for quake3 that is no longer used by TMNT Arena.

So if I ever decide to try and run TMNT Arena with a unmodified ioquake3 (Need the PNG and Ogg Vobis support) there is some data here.


The file scripts/weaponinfo.txt attempts to recreate the Quake3 and Team Arena weapons
	using the weapon scripting for TMNT Arena.

This was done to improve the weapon system and in case someone wanted to use quake3's weapons with TMNT Arena's weapon scripting.
