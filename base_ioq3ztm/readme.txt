"ioq3ztm" is ioquake3 with some of the changes from TMNT Arena.

This data contains the needed scripts/weaponinfo.txt as well as extra
[q3 replacement] data made for TMNT Arena that is no longer used by TMNT Arena.

== Usage ==
Idealy there should be a directory in the quake3 folder
	"/path/to/quake3/ioq3ztm/"
 that contains the ioq3ztm qvm files and the TMNT Arena pak0.pk3 and *this*
 ioq3ztm data as "pak1_ioq3ztm.pk3"

 So data override as ioq3ztm > TMNT Arena > [Team Arena >] Quake III: Arena
