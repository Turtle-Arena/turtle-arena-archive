This directory contains replacement data for quake3 that is no longer used by
	Turtle Arena. May be useful for creating a full quake3 data replacement or
	something when combined with the Turtle Arena data.
	Note, PNG/OGG are only support by ioquake3, so would need to be convert
	to TGA/WAV to support original quake3.

== Extra: Quake3 and Q3:Team Arena in Turtle Arena ==
The file scripts/weaponinfo.txt attempts to recreate the Quake3 and
	Q3:Team Arena weapons using the weapon scripting system in Turtle Arena.
	This was done to improve the weapon system and in case someone wanted to use
	Q3/Team Arena's weapons using Turtle Arena's weapon scripting system.
