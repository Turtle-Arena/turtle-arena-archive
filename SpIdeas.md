Single player / co-op mode ideas.

## Design ##
  * Game intro before the menu, and possibly after the final level. No cutscenes between levels or in the middle of levels.
  * Have each "stage" contain three levels. Two standard reach the end levels and a boss fight.
  * Each stage has its own "totally different" environment and overall color if possible.
  * Per-stage gimmick or two.
  * The game should have 5 or more stages.
  * Should start with a few basic enemies and add new types in each stage, possibly making previous ones less common.

## Stage Ideas ##
  * City
  * Country / Forest
  * Underground caves with water
  * Desert with western town
  * Snowy Mountain
  * Spacestation

## Enemy Ideas ##
Enemies are planned to be robots.

  * Humaniod robots (two arms/legs and carry weapon)?
  * Insect robots?
  * Flying robots
