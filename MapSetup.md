**Maps** can be created using a Quake III map editor, such as GtkRadiant 1.5.0 or NetRadiant.

# NetRadiant #
NetRadiant is a map editor which is a fork of GtkRadiant that fixes bug and adds new features.
For information on installing and compiling see http://www.icculus.org/netradiant/ or use the setup below.

## NetRadiant Setup ##
First you need to install a map editor, such as NetRadiant.
Go to http://www.icculus.org/netradiant/ and download NetRadiant for your operating system, or build it from source.

**If building from source, skip this step.**
After downloading extract NetRadiant to a directory such as "C:\Program Files\NetRadiant\" on windows or "/usr/share/netradiant/"? on GNU/Linux.

# Setup the Turtle Arena config #

Copy the files inside of the source "extras/radiant-config/" directory (Either from tmntarena-src.zip in the alpha or from the subversion repository) into the directory were you install NetRadiant (i.e. "C:\Program Files\NetRadiant")

When you start NetRadiant select "Turtle Arena" in the drop-down list of games. You can also set "Show Global Preferences" to unchecked to always go into Turtle Arena mapping, skipping the game select if you are not going to edit maps for other games (This can be changed later in the Edit -> Preferences -> Global -> Game).

# Final #
You now have NetRadiant ready to make maps for Turtle Arena! See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GtkRadiant for how to use Radiant.
