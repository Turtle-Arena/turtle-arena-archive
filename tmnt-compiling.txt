Currently the easist way to compile TMNT Arena is GNU Make.

1) Unzip "tmnt-src-*.zip" into the main TMNT Arena directory (There is a directory named "src" inside zip)

=== GNU Make ===
2) In a terminal change to the src/engine/ directory and run "make"
3) Output will be in src/engine/build/*dir*/ (Where *dir* is something like "release-linux-x86")

=== Code::Blocks ===
NOTE: Compiling only works on Windows. However it can be used to view and edit the source on GNU/Linux.
2) Open src/engine/misc/code_blocks/ioq3.workspace
3) Rebuild workspace.
4) Output will be in src/engine/build

Defines maybe out of date... so copy the defines from the TMNT config section of the Makefile
	into all projects less Splines.
:(note to self): Move the defining to a header file?

=== Microsoft Visual C++ ===
Currently unsupported. There are project files for ioquake3 in src/engine/misc/msvc/.

Below are changes that ''should'' make the ioquake3 projects compile TMNT Arena. This is untested.

Worspace:
src/engine/code/splines/Splines.vcproj

Quake3 project:
Link to output library of Splines project.

Cgame project:
Add below to project
src/tmnta-engine/code/cgame/cg_npcs.c

Game project:
Add below to project
src/engine/code/game/g_npc.c
src/engine/code/game/g_npcmove.c
src/engine/code/game/g_npcthink.c
src/engine/code/game/g_save.c
src/engine/code/game/g_paths.c

Copy the defines from the TMNT config section of the Makefile into all projects less Splines.
:(note to self): Move the defining to a header file?
