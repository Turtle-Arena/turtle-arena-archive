Currently the easist way to compile TMNT Arena is GNU Make.

=== GNU Make ===
1) In a terminal change to the engine/ directory and run "make"
2) Output will be in engine/build/*dir*/ (Where *dir* is something like "release-linux-x86")

=== Code::Blocks ===
NOTE: Compiling only works on Windows. However it can be used to view and edit the source on GNU/Linux.
1) Open engine/misc/code_blocks/ioq3.workspace
2) Rebuild workspace
3) Output will be in engine/build/

Defines maybe out of date... so copy the defines from the TMNT config section of the Makefile
	into all projects (Except Splines and BSPC).

=== Microsoft Visual C++ ===
Currently unsupported. There are project files for ioquake3 in engine/misc/msvc/.

Below are changes that ''should'' make the ioquake3 projects compile TMNT Arena. This is untested.

Workspace:
Add below to workspace
engine/code/splines/Splines.vcproj

Quake3 project:
Link to output library of Splines project.

Cgame project:
Add below to project
engine/code/cgame/cg_npcs.c

Game project:
Add below to project
engine/code/game/g_npc.c
engine/code/game/g_npcmove.c
engine/code/game/g_npcthink.c
engine/code/game/g_save.c
engine/code/game/g_paths.c

Copy the defines from the TMNT config section of the Makefile into all projects (Except Splines).
