This package was debianized by Zack "ZTurtleMan" Middleton <ZTurtleMan@gmail.com> on
Fri, 28 May 2010 17:35:12 +0500.

It was downloaded from http://turtlearena.googlecode.com/

The tarball was repacked to leave out the non-free code/tools/lcc directory
and the code/libs directory containing libraries for Mac OS X and Win32
without source.
