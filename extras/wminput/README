Turtle Arena Wiimote support for GNU/Linux.

Wiimote support is currently external from Turtle Arena, using wminput which uses the cwiid library.

== USAGE ==
Launch the game using turtlearena-wiimote, turtlearena-wiimote-side, or turtlearena-wiimote-nun.

== SETUP ==
To use wminput you need to change /dev/uinput to be readable by all, and load uinput.

	sudo chmod 0666 /dev/uinput
	sudo modprobe uinput
	echo "uinput # Added for turtlearena-wiimote package" | tee -a /etc/modules

== UNSETUP ==
Stop auto loading of uinput. Revert permissions of /dev/uinput

	sudo sed -i -e 's/uinput # Added by turtlearena-wiimote package//g' /etc/modules
	sudo chmod 0640 /dev/uinput
