mm3d_patch.diff is a patch for Misfit Model 3D writen by ZTurtleMan to add support for non-quake3 md3 players.
It adds support for Quake III: Team Arena, Smokin' Guns, and others mods (Like TMNT Arena).

This patch is required to export the TMNT Arena players from mm3d to md3.

There are still things that are not general, like the hard coded list of animations that use loopframes.

It adds code for MDR models, but is unfinished (It can't import or export yet).
