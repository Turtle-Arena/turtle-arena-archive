md3filter.cc/h are from Misfit Model 3D. They have been modified by ZTurtleMan to add support for non-quake3 md3 players.
It adds support for Quake III: Team Arena, Smokin' Guns (untested!), and others mods (Like TMNT Arena).

This patch is required to export the TMNT Arena players from mm3d to md3.

There are still things that are not general, like the hard coded list of animations that use loopframes.

It adds code for MDR models, but is unfinished (It can't import or export yet).

= Changes =
Incomplete list of changes.

== Animations.cfg ==
Animation name is loaded from the animations.cfg, with fallback to default q3 name, instead of just a hardcoded list.

Reads/Saves all of the animations instead of just the first 25 (MD3_ANIMATIONS).

== Metadata ==
Changes add suppport for MD3_CFG_* metadata to insert data into animations.cfg
	(Still supports hardcoded MD3_footsteps, MD3_headoffset, etc)

If MD3_EliteLoop value is 1 uses STV: Elite Force Single Player style loopframes
	(Where 0 is loop, and -1 is don't loop in animations.cfg)

If MD3_AnimKeyword value is 1 uses Elite Force Single Player style animation list
Example: "BOTH_DEATH1 0 5 5 15"
