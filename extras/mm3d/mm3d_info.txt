md3filter.cc/h are from Misfit Model 3D, they have been modified by ZTurtleMan to add support for non-quake3 md3 players.
mm3d_changes.diff contains changes for other files that have been changed.

Adds support for Quake III: Team Arena and others mods (like Turtle Arena).

These changes are required to export the Turtle Arena players from mm3d to md3.

= Changes =
Incomplete list of changes.

== MDR ==
Unfinished support for MDR models. MDR model are basically skeleton animated MD3 models.

Compressed MDR models only allow bone joints in the range of -512 to 511.
If your model is bigger set MDR_compressed to 0.

== Animation Looping ==
* "Loop" in the Animation Mode is now per-animation (with undo support)
* Loop is read and wrote to and fro .mm3d files (compatible with current .mm3d files)
* Per-animation loop is supported by md3filter (No more handcoded list)

== Animations.cfg ==
Animation name is loaded from the animations.cfg, with fallback to default q3 name, instead of just a hardcoded list.

Reads/Saves all of the animations instead of just the first 25 (MD3_ANIMATIONS).

== Metadata ==
Changes add suppport for MD3_CFG_* metadata to insert data into animations.cfg
	(Still supports hardcoded MD3_footsteps, MD3_headoffset, etc et)

If MD3_EliteLoop value is 1 uses STV: Elite Force Single Player style loopframes
	(Where 0 is loop, and -1 is don't loop in animations.cfg)

If MD3_AnimKeyword value is 1 uses Elite Force Single Player style animation list
Example: "BOTH_DEATH1 0 5 5 15"

If MDR_compressed value is 0 does not compress the MDR model(s).
