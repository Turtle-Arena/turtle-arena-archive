TMNT Arena Ideas file (Formarly "todo" file)

TODO: Move this stuff somewhere else and remove this file.

== Single Player Design/Story ==
* Base on 2003 TV series or just be standalone?

* Something like "Turtles In Time" or maybe somewhat more like "The Hyperstone Heist"
** Each stage has its own "total different" environment
** Per-level gimmick or two
** Light on story (Meaning no long cutscenes between, or in the middle of, levels)
** Have each "stage" contain multiple levels (Have all/most contain the same number).

== Stage Ideas ==
* New York / City
** Sewer and/or Underground
** Streets and/or Rooftops
* Country / (Casey's Grandmother's farmhouse)
** Forest
* Water (Surf level)?
* Desert/Mountain
* Snow
* Foot base in space

* Usagi's world?
* Moo Mesa?

=== Stage story Idea ===
Enemy:		Environment:		Story stuff.

Mousers:	Underground:		The Turtles are attacked near their lair by Mousers
Foot:		Streets/Rooftops:	and head for the rooftops. After battling the Foot,
???:		Country/Forest:		they head to Casey's Grandmother's farmhouse. While exploring the Forest, they find something and
???:		Water?:				fall into a underground river (with mutant? creators), and
???:		Desert/Mountain:	end up in a Desert. They climb the mountain (for some reason)
???:		Snow:				At the top of the Mountain is a transmat which teleports them to a space station.
Foot:		Space:				Shredders on the space station. He must be stopped.

== Enemy Ideas ==
* The Foot
* Mousers
* The Purple Dragons possibly
* The Earth Protection Force
** Agent Bishop

== Objects ==
: Objects and NPCs share lots of code...

TODO: Make more mapobjects;
Most of the mapobjects should be damageable.

  * Clump of tall grass (Like in TMNT2 NGC level 2 and LoZ:TP)
  * Animated flower bud

Trees, bushes, flowers, tall-grasses,
Traffic barrel-thingy? Traffic "saw-horse"-thingy
Firehydroant, lightpole,
street-signs (one-way, 3rd street, Stop, Yield, people crossing, speed limit)

Style 1: Option to animate and trigger "target" on touch,
Style 2: Damageable and have a "paintarget" and trigger "target" on death.
