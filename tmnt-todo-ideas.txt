TMNT Arena Ideas file (Formarly "todo" file)

TODO: Clean up this file...

Do "play testing" to find bugs and to find things to change, improve, and add.
	I need to remind myself as I end up doing alot of code/data changes with no or little testing.

== General ==

=== Demo 1 or later ===
* Rewrite single player post-game data saving. Have it be more like in Team Arena then Q3, using ".game" files instead of cvars in config.
: Or one single data file with all of the sp data (Or SP data files -like SRB2 2.0)

=== Future ===
: Ideas for things to maybe do in the future, shouldn't try to do for demo 1.

* NPCs (Sort of started, I replaced the TDC NPC stuff -totally removed the thinking code, however)
* NPRQuake has some awesome rendering options... (If I wanted it to look like a comic book it might help.)
* Word filter http://code.google.com/p/sgfork/source/detail?r=5

=== Single Player Design/"Story" ===
Ideas;
* Try to fit into the 2003 TV series or just be standalone?
* Have there be stages containing multiple levels.
* Have one of the stages take place in Usagi's world
* Have one of the stages take place in Moo Mesa?
* The Purple Dragons may appear
* The Earth Protection Force (Agent Bishop) may appear
* It is unknown if The Foot will appear.
* Mousers may appear

== Player Models ==
List of tags by models.

head.md3
+ tag_head
//+tag_bandana -- TODO: Bandanas, how hard can it be right?... Yeah. Right...

upper.md3
+ tag_torso
+ tag_head
+ tag_hand_primary   -- Player's right hand. Used for holding guns/melee weapons.
+ tag_hand_secondary -- Player's left hand. Used for holding CTF flags/melee weapons.
// Hold default weapon of the player when not in use.
+ tag_wp_away_primary
+ tag_wp_away_secondary
// Currently I just use tag_weapon / tag_flag so that TMNT skins can be used in Quake III/Team Arena...
+ tag_weapon (for Quake 3/STV:EF? capatibility) -- Use like tag_hand_primary
+ tag_flag   (for Team Arena capatibility) -- Use like tag_hand_secondary
// What tag(s) does Elite Force use?

lower.md3
+ tag_torso

Melee Weapon attack animations.
      TMNT Mutant Melee: sword type, axe/hammer type, gun type (Already in Q3...)
      TMNT Arena: TMNT:MM types plus Bo, Nunchuk, and more sword types

== Camera ==
Modify the camera system to;
* work with Analog Control in online/offline play. (cg_thirdPersonAnalog)
* Support focusing on 4 players with one camera, for a local 4 player game (splitscreen would be optional).

=== Menu ===
Use MISSIONPACK scripted menus.
See tmnt-menus.txt

=== HUD ===
Use MISSIONPACK scripted hud.

== Objects ==
: Objects and NPCs share lots of code...

TODO: Make more mapobjects;
Most of the mapobjects should be breakable.

Trees, bushes, flowers, tall-grasses,
Traffic barrel-thingy? Traffic "saw-horse"-thingy
Firehydroant, lightpole,
street-signs (one-way, 3rd street, Stop, Yield, people crossing, speed limit)

misc_object
Style 1: Option to animate and trigger "target" on touch,
Style 2: Damageable and have a "paintarget" and trigger "target" on death.
			TODO: Also option to spawn item on death, and option to respawn.

== Weapons ==
TMNTWEAPSYS is the main changes to Q3's weapon system.
* Adds melee weapon system
* Adds default weapon (Clients get one default weapon that is set per-player in animation.cfg)
** Pointless in stock Q3... as it is limited to one default weapon, Guntlet. (Guns as default aren't supported).
* It may do other things to Q3 weapon system, but I don't remember what they are.
* There are weapon "groups", weapons, and projectiles.
* The weap group, weap, and proj info is loaded from external text files.
** This allows for custom weapons (Custom weapons in custom maps, and custom default weapons for players)

TMNTWEAPSYS_EX is weapon code that adds on to TMNTWEAPSYS, making it more complete for a hand-to-hand game (Like Mutant Melee)
* Each client can hold only 2 weapons (instead of upto 16), one is the default and the other is a pickup weapon, if holding a pickup weapon the default weapon can't be used.
** The player will have three weapons when switching to a new pickup weapon, while holding a pickup weapon.
* Removes 16 total weapons limit.
* Picked up weapons can be dropped via a button to use the default weapon again.
** Backport to TMNTWEAPSYS? so players can drop a single weapon?
* Auto drops guns when out of ammo (When player doesn't have PW_AMMOREGEN)

TMNTWEAPONS Replace/remove Q3/TA's weapons with TMNT weapons.

TMNTHOLDSYS Allow up to 16 holdable items to be held at once (Like Q3 weapon sys, players can change to any holdable)

TMNTHOLDABLE Adds shurikens and disables some Q3/TA holdables.

TMNT_GAME_MODELS Game is able to load models and get tag pos and angles (Allowing for better melee attacking)
: Note the polygons (etc) are loaded as well, but currently unused. (tmnt ded server uses more RAM then q3 ded server.)

Add Bow and Arrow? (Like LoZ:TP) { Camera looks over player's shoulder }
* ("Charge up" weapon (and animate player), when fully charged fire projectile (or fire on release weaponFlag?) )

== Stages ==
Idea: Have a "stages.txt" that contains.
Support up to 9 maps.

{
name = "Stage 1"
image = levelshots/stage1.png
caption = ??? // Support caption/desction about the Stage?
showareaselect = 0 // Don't show even if beat the first area.
showareaselect = 1 // default --if more then one area, and the first is beat, show area select
showareaselect = 2 // Show even if only one area or the first hasn't been beat.
map1 = sp1a1
map2 = sp1a2
map3 = sp1a3
map4 = sp1a4
}

{
name = "Stage 2"
image = levelshots/stage2.png
map1 = sp2a1
map2 = sp2a2
map3 = sp2a3
map4 = sp2a4
map5 = sp2a5
}

{
name = "Stage 3 (Beta)"
//no "image"
map1 = sp3a1
}
