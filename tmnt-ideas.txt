TMNT Arena Ideas file (Formarly "todo" file)

TODO: Clean up this file...

Soon I'd like to start working on making it "playable",
	so I can release a playable alpha version.

What do I mean by "playable", well a animated player (who looks "good") [and what?]

Do "play testing" to find bugs and to find things to change, improve, and add.

== General ==

=== Demo 1 or later ===
* Rewrite single player post-game data saving. Have it be more like in Team Arena then Q3, using ".game" files instead of cvars in config.

* New teleport effect;
: After teleporting have player "glow" blueish (using a shader, and Dlight?) and have player be non-solid (move though other players) and don't take damage (or low damage with random miss/hit). Time for the effect should be like 3 seconds and then flash and be normal (solid, no tele effect shader).

* DONE: Add the needed stuff to replace "botfiles/weapons.c" with "scripts/weaponinfo.txt" (and scripts/*.weap)
* Have scripted movements for attacks, so that player don't just swing there arms? They stop and swing there arms, etc.

=== Future ===
: Ideas for things to maybe do in the future, shouldn't try to do for demo 1.

* Rewrite CTF flag rendering so that there is one flag model with three skins?
** This may help http://xreal.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xreal?view=rev&revision=3173
** and this      http://xreal.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xreal?view=rev&revision=3202

* Add support for .ogm video playback (Xreal copied from World of Padman engine)
	(It really should be in ioq3, so that each standalone mod doesn't add support for it...)
** This may help http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/xreal/changeset/3297
** and this      http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/xreal/changeset/3300

* NPCs
* New camera system : merge CAMERASCRIPT with realtime camera.
* Savegames for single player.

* Use freetype for TTF rendering, instead of q3font.exe's output files of a TTF. (Almost completed in Xreal)
* Get code/ogg and code/vobis from XReal? (Ogg vorbis works but should the code for it be in our source? Lke jpeg/speex/etc)
* Support models/players/NAME/animsounds.cfg used in STV:EF (SP?) (Also used in JK2) ?

* NPRQuake has some awesome rendering options... (If I wanted it to look like a comic book it might help.)

* Word filter http://smokinguns.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/smokinguns?view=rev&revision=189

== Player Models ==
List of tags by models.

head.md3
+ tag_head
//+tag_bandana -- TODO: Bandanas, how hard can it be right?... Yeah. Right...

upper.md3
+ tag_torso
+ tag_head
+ tag_hand_primary   -- Player's right hand. Used for holding guns/melee weapons.
+ tag_hand_secondary -- Player's left hand. Used for holding CTF flags/melee weapons.
// Hold default weapon of the player when not in use.
+ tag_wp_away_primary
+ tag_wp_away_secondary
// Currently I just use tag_weapon / tag_flag so that TMNT skins can be used in Quake 3 and Team arena...
+ tag_weapon (for Quake 3/STV:EF? capatibility) -- Use like tag_hand_primary
+ tag_flag   (for Team Arena capatibility) -- Use like tag_hand_secondary
// What tag(s) does Elite Force use?
//+ tag_lhand  ?? (for Elite Force capatibility??) -- Use like tag_hand_secondary??

lower.md3
+ tag_torso
//+ tag_foot_primary
//+ tag_foot_secondary

Melee Weapon attack animations.
      TMNT Mutant Melee: sword type, axe/hammer type, gun type (Already in Q3...)
      TMNT Arena: TMNT:MM types plus Bo, Nunchuk, and more sword types

== Camera ==
The Q3 camera system needs to be rewritten, third person with be the default camera so it needs to work better.
The new camera system should be desined to;
* work with Analog Control in online/offline play.
* run "scripts", I hope to remove the need for external textfiles from the map.
* Possible "base" on ZCam? (--Non-GPL...) It is a enhanced spectator camera.
* Support focusing on 4 players with one camera, for a local 4 player game (splitscreen would be optional).
* more.

=== Analog Control ===
TODO Analog mode:
Analog should work in Netplay as well as offline. Should analog be client side or server side?,
	clients can predicted it as well (if on server side)?

cg_thirdPersonAnalog
cg_thirdPersonAngle - Modify while cg_thirdPersonAnalog is 1.
cg_thirdPersonRange
cg.predictedPlayerState.viewheight?
See also: CL_CreateCmd

== MISSIONPACK ==
Use parts of the MISSIONPACK
ui scripting, and better team play stuff?

DONE: Support 1 Flag CTF and Overload gametypes
DONE: Use redFlagBaseModel and blueFlagBaseModel
DONE: Use MISSIONPACK's new CTF flag code, flagPoleModel, flagFlapModel, and redFlagFlapSkin
DONE (Code is done, Raph has no skins for it): Per-Team skins in team play.

=== Menu ===
Use MISSIONPACK scripted menus.
See tmnt-menus.txt

=== HUD ===
Use MISSIONPACK scripted hud.

== Objects ==
TODO: Make more mapobjects;
Most of the mapobjects should be breakable.

Trees, bushes, flowers, tall-grasses,
Traffic barrel-thingy? Traffic "saw-horse"-thingy
Firehydroant, lightpole,
street-signs (one-way, 3rd street, Stop, Yield, people crossing, speed limit)

misc_object
Style 1: Option to animate and trigger "target" on touch,
Style 2: Damageable and have a "paintarget" and trigger "target" on death.
			TODO: Also option to spawn item on death, and option to respawn.

== Weapons ==
TMNTWEAPSYS is the main changes to Q3's weapon system.
* Adds melee weapon system
* Adds default weapon (Clients get one default weapon that is set per-player in animation.cfg)
** Pointless in stock Q3... as it is limited to one default weapon, Guntlet. (Guns as default aren't supported).
* It may do other things to Q3 weapon system, but I don't remember what they are.

TMNTWEAPSYS2 is weapon code that adds on to TMNTWEAPSYS, making it more "complete."
* Each client can hold only 2 weapons (instead of upto 16), one is the default and the other is a pickup weapon, if holding a pickup weapon the default weapon can't be used.
* Removes 16 total weapons limit.
* Picked up weapons can be dropped via a button to use the default weapon again.
* Disables ammo warnings (AMMO_WARNINGS), TODO: Fix CG_CheckAmmo to support TMNTWEAPSYS2?
* Auto drops guns when out of ammo (When player doesn't have PW_AMMOREGEN)

TMNTWEAPONS Replace/remove Q3/TA's weapons with TMNT weapons. (Currently it has some of the SYS stuff, need to fix)
Q3's weapons have "_hand.md3" models for each gun, I currently use one of OpenArena for all weapons.

TMNTHOLDSYS Allow up to 16 holdable items to be held at once (Like Q3 weapon sys, players can change to any holdable)

TMNTHOLDABLE Adds shurikens (Which are holdable items) and disables some Q3/TA holdables.

TMNT_GAME_TAGS Game is able to load models and get tag pos and angles (Allowing for better melee attacking)
: Rename to TMNT_GAME_MODELS as the polygons (etc) are loaded as well?

// NO_COLOR_BAR
EF_AWARD_BITS // Have this be IOQ3ZTM?

// CG_ShotgunPattern // TMNTWEAPSYS_2 should remove all of the special shotgun stuff as it replaces the hardcode
//                        stuff with simpler stuff (based on missionpack code) (that uses more bandwidth?)
//						Ug, yeah well the new code for shotgun doesn't work right...

Weapon Types;
Add more stock weapons/types?
* Ultimate Ninja's claw (and Shredder's hand blades)?
** Just offset the model in the MD3 so it looks like its on his wrist? Or don't even use a seperate model...
* Bow and Arrow? (Like LOZ: TP) { Camera looks over players shoulder }
** ("Charge up" weapon (and animate player), when fully charged fire projectile (or fire on release weaponFlag?) )

== Stages ==
Idea: have a "stages.txt" that contains.
Support up to 9 maps.

{
name = "Stage 1"
image = levelshots/stage1.png
caption = ??? // Support caption/desction about the Stage?
showareaselect = 0 // Don't show even if beat the first area.
showareaselect = 1 // default --if more then one area, and the first is beat, show area select
showareaselect = 2 // Show even if only one area or the first hasn't been beat.
map1 = sp1a1
map2 = sp1a2
map3 = sp1a3
map4 = sp1a4
}

{
name = "Stage 2"
image = levelshots/stage2.png
map1 = sp2a1
map2 = sp2a2
map3 = sp2a3
map4 = sp2a4
map5 = sp2a5
}

{
name = "Stage 3 (Beta)"
//no "image"
map1 = sp3a1
}

== Dead ==
Stuff that I should delete... [from this text file]

=== Real Melee Attacking (Done) ===
If we move LerpFrame stuff from cg/ui to bg, we would have the animations correct
	but we would still need the model to find the tag locations,
	(FIXED: Now ded can load models)
	so we would need to load the tags from the models, without using the render.

Move lerpFrame_t to bg_public.h
Copy CG_RunLerpFrame CG_SetLerpFrameAnimation and CG_ClearLerpFrame to bg as BG_*
Disable CG_RunLerpFrame CG_SetLerpFrameAnimation and CG_ClearLerpFrame
Disable UI_RunLerpFrame UI_SetLerpFrameAnimation
Add "lerpFrame_t legs, torso;" to gclient_s
Run the gclient_s legs/torso lerp in game

Side Effects:
* Use more net bandwith; If lerpFrame was move to bg, the torso and legs would have to be sent across
	the network as only the "local player" is run though Pmove().
** fix -- Leave legs/torso/flag to playerEntity_t, but use BG_* lerp funtions.

LerpFrame stuff:
lerpFrame_t
CG_RunLerpFrame CG_SetLerpFrameAnimation and CG_ClearLerpFrame
UI_RunLerpFrame UI_SetLerpFrameAnimation
== Players ==
This was said about the 2003 series first console game.
    Leonardo
    Strength: Best attack accuracy.
    Weakness:-Cannot dodge attacks as well as everyone else.

    Donatello
    Strength: Longest attack reach.
    Weakness: Slowest.

    Michaelangelo
    Strength: Fastest
    Weakness: Lowest attack accuracy

    Raphael
    Strength: Most powerful of all the turtles.
    Weakness: Shortest attack reach.

== What is wanted ==
I was reading some reviews of the 2003 series games and I decide to make a list of what people said is missing or needs in the games. Its very incomplete.

* 4-player support (lacked in the first game) --Will 64 players on LAN/internet do?...
* Good stages
* Mutant Melee had small stages
* Better attack controls
